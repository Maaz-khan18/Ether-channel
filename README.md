# Ether-channel
Networking Lab: EtherChannel Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer | This project showcases a virtual networking lab built in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate the configuration and functionality of EtherChannel ‚Äî a port aggregation technology used to enhance bandwidth and redundancy between switches.
üîß Objectives
- Understand the concept and configuration of EtherChannel.
- Build a scalable and resilient switch-to-switch network topology.
- Demonstrate load balancing and fault tolerance using bundled links.
- Practice CLI-based configuration and troubleshooting in Cisco Packet Tracer.
üñ•Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation environment)
- EtherChannel (Layer 2 port aggregation)
- Switches & PCs (Cisco 2960 switches, end devices)
- CLI commands for configuration and verification
üõ†Ô∏è Key Configurations
- Created a topology with multiple switches connected via FastEthernet links.
- Configured EtherChannel using both PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) and LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).
- Verified EtherChannel status using show etherchannel summary and show interfaces port-channel.
- Simulated link failures to test redundancy and failover capabilities.
üìà Outcomes
- Successfully established logical port-channel interfaces between switches.
- Achieved increased bandwidth and improved network stability.
- Gained hands-on experience with Cisco CLI and EtherChannel troubleshooting.
- Demonstrated how EtherChannel can optimize network performance in enterprise environments.
