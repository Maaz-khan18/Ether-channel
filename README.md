# Ether-channel
Networking Lab: EtherChannel Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer | This project showcases a virtual networking lab built in Cisco Packet Tracer to demonstrate the configuration and functionality of EtherChannel â€” a port aggregation technology used to enhance bandwidth and redundancy between switches.
# Objectives
- Understand the concept and configuration of EtherChannel.
- Build a scalable and resilient switch-to-switch network topology.
- Demonstrate load balancing and fault tolerance using bundled links.
- Practice CLI-based configuration and troubleshooting in Cisco Packet Tracer.
# Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer (simulation environment)
- EtherChannel (Layer 2 port aggregation)
- Switches & PCs (Cisco 2950-24 switches, end devices)
- CLI commands for configuration and verification
# Key Configurations
- Created a topology with 2 switches connected via FastEthernet links.
- Configured EtherChannel using both PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) and LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).
- Verified EtherChannel status using show etherchannel summary and show interfaces port-channel.
- Simulated link failures to test redundancy and failover capabilities.
# Outcomes
- Successfully established logical port-channel interfaces between switches.
- Achieved increased bandwidth and improved network stability.
- Gained hands-on experience with Cisco CLI and EtherChannel troubleshooting.
- Demonstrated how EtherChannel can optimize network performance in enterprise environments.
